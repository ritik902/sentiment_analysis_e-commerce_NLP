# sentiment_analysis_e-commerce_NLP
Developed a machine learning project using natural language processing to analyze and interpret product reviews for an e-commerce website. I used 3 models to compare check the efficiency and accuracy- XGBoost, LR, LSTM. The project focused on enhancing customer experience by extracting valuable insights from reviews, identifying sentiment trends, and providing recommendations to improve products and services.
